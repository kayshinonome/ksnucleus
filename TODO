Data Types:
    Array:
        Allow for implicit conversion for array types of different sizes
        Add stack operations to the array
    Future:
        Make a future type that calls back to retrieve the initial value from a callback function pointers
        Make the type async proof
        Make the type multiprocessor proof
        Make the type completely transparent so that it is interchangeable with other types that it wraps
    String:
        Make a string type (based on char[]) so that safe and effective string operations can be made
    SpinLock:
        Make a spinlock type to control how locking works
Build system:
    Makefile:
        Clean them up. They look like garbage
    Libraries:
        Merge libksnutils into the main nucleus source. Most of it is header so there is no point in keeping it separate
        Give each ksnutils data type its own header
Platform and Arch support:
    Quarks:
        Write a VESA quark that can, at the least, commit a framebuffer to video memory (at 640x480 with a depth of 16)
        Write a 8250 quark that can, at the least, push a byte out, and pull a byte in (this will require a good implementation of the Future class)
    Runtime:
        Add a v86 bios wrapper for x86-pc-32-little, for things such as changing video mode, or reading the disk
