# x86

## Requirements
-  CPU Model: i486-SL
-  CPU Features: x87, cpuid
-  Work RAM: ~1MB
-  Video RAM: {To calculate}
-  General Hardware: VGA or similar (EGA, CGA possibly in the future)

## Reasons for requirements
-  CPU Model: The i486 has guarenteed x87 support (except in SX models). The SL models has guarenteed cpuid support.
-  CPU Features: These features are needed for reasonable ease of development.
-  Work RAM: Currently this is the amount of RAM the nucleus is guarenteed to have.
-  Video RAM: 
-  General Hardware: Some sort of video hardware is required that can support video modes, later this will be lowered.
